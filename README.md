# BIP
Transaction Layering Protocol for Block Space Optimization!
Technical Terminology

P2PKH: Retained as standard Bitcoin script type abbreviation
Dynamically opened: emphasizing resource availability
Preserve essential bandwidth: technical accuracy for Layer2 needs
Structural Integrity
Maintained original hierarchical format using Markdown syntax for BIP compliance

Precision Enhancements

Added "during block congestion" to clarify delay context
Explicitly marked ">30 minutes" with mathematical symbol
Used "containing" instead of "including" for script verification semantics

Key Implementation Notes
Transaction Classification Engine

Uses IsInnovationTx method for dual-condition validation
Extended Solver function in script detection module to support P2PKH identification
Dynamic Quota Control

Calculates base capacity using MAX_BLOCK_SERIALIZED_SIZE
Implements hard-coded 80% allocation for payment transactions per BIP specification
Mempool Management

Utilizes CTxMemPool::txiter for transaction iteration
Implements dual-queue pattern to separate payment/innovation transactions
Block Assembly Logic

Enforces strict payment-first packaging order
Uses cumulative size calculation to prevent overflows

Compatibility Statement
This implementation is compatible with:

BIP141 (Segregated Witness)
BIP152 (Compact Block Relay)
BIP125 (Opt-In Replace-By-Fee)
Note that mining nodes must synchronize updates to transaction pool management policies. Recommended deployment via version bits (versionbits) for soft fork implementation.
